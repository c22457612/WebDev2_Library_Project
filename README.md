# Description

I created this website using XAMPP and phpMyAdmin,
All files included were placed in the 'htdocs' folder when using XAMPP

This website code allows users to log in/register while authenticating users, search for books by
title/author, browse by categories, reserve books, and manage reservations. All interactive features give positive
or negative feedback to the user to help them use the website features correctly. 
Followed CRUD (Create, Read,Update, Delete) methodology.
Ensures secure user authentication and efficient database queries to handle a large volume of book
records.
